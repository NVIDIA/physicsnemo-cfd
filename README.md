## What is PhysicsNeMo CFD?

NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo-CFD is a sub-module of [NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo
framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/) that provides the tools
needed to integrate pretrained AI models into engineering and CFD workflows.

The library is a collection of loosely-coupled workflows around the trained AI
models for CFD, with abstractions and relevant data structures.

Refer to the [PhysicsNeMo
framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/blob/main/README.md) to learn
more about the full stack.

The library offers utilities for:

- **NIM Inference**:
  - An inference recipe calling a pre-trained AI models that were trained using
PhysicsNeMo and hosted as NVIDIA Inference Microservices (for example, the
[DoMINO Automotive Aerodynamics
NIM](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nim/teams/nvidia/containers/domino-automotive-aero))
from a Python interface, facilitating scalable deployment of trained models.
- **Benchmarking of ML Model Accuracy**:
  - A benchmark for evaluating and validating the results of trained ML models
  against traditional CFD results using broad set of built-in engineering
  metrics (for example, pointwise errors, integrated quantities, spectral
  metrics, PDE residuals)
  - Utilities to extend and build custom metrics, analyze, and visulaize the
    results of trained ML model, both mesh-based and point-cloud based models

- **Hybrid Initialization**:
  - An end-to-end recipe illustrating initializing a CFD simulation with a
  trained ML model hybridized with potential flow solutions, to accelerate CFD
  convergence (particularly for high-fidelity, unsteady cases).[related
  publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15766)

## Getting started

To get started use the DoMINO NIM on a sample as shown below:

```python
from physicsnemo.cfd.inference.domino_nim import call_domino_nim
import subprocess

filenames = [
    "drivaer_202.stl",
]
urls = [
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/neashton/drivaerml/resolve/main/run_202/drivaer_202.stl",
]

for url, filename in zip(urls, filenames):
    subprocess.run(["wget", url, "-O", filename], check=True)

output_dict = call_domino_nim(
    stl_path="./drivaer_202.stl",
    inference_api_url="http://localhost:8000/v1/infer",
    data={
        "stream_velocity": "38.89",
        "stencil_size": "1",
        "point_cloud_size": "500000",
    },
    verbose=True,
)

```

Refer to the [`workflows` directory](./workflows) for detailed instructions on
executing individual reference workflows and samples. These are primarily
packaged as Jupyter notebooks where possible, to provide for inline
documentation and visualization of expected results.

## Installation

PhysicsNeMo-CFD is a Python package that depends on the [NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo
framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo).

For maximum cross-platform compatibility, we recommend using the PhysicsNeMo
Docker container. Steps to use PhysicsNeMo container can be found [in the
Getting
Started](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/getting-started/index.html#physicsnemo-with-docker-image-recommended).

You can also install PhysicsNeMo-CFD via pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/PhysicsNeMo-CFD.git
cd physicsnemo-cfd
pip install .
```

To get access to GPU accelerated functionalities from this repo when installing
in a conda or a custom python environment please run

```bash
pip install .[gpu] --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

> [!Note] PhysicsNeMo-CFD is an experimental library and currently v0; expect
> breaking changes. PhysicsNeMo-CFD is for *demonstrating* workflows, rather
than providing a stable API for production-level deployments.

When updating, see the latest changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
file.
